# Description of Hand Game(Rock, Paper, Scissors)
## This is a rundown of what was learnt durong my day one of python marathon(as I like to call it) using a hand game that was built.

### Variables
Variables are used to store data and it does not have any semi-colon at its end unlike other programming languages

### Functions
Functions is used to hold colllection of codes that can executed at a later time.

### input
A keyword that is used to collect a user info/data

### import
A keyword used to connect another file/directory/code to a particular file/code.

### dictionary
It is used to store data in form of keys and values. Example: "player": "Neymar" equals "key": "value"

### List
It is used to stores values like strings. It does not come in key/value pair, just values. Kind of like an array in JavaScript.

### If and elif statement
This is a conditional statement that runs or return a code/result if a certain requirement is met.

### Data Types
Few that I can remember are:
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Dictionary
- List
- Tuple
- Boolean
- Sets

### Indention
This is a very important concept in python that requires one to keep spaces when writing a new line of code based on the hierarchy in which the code is been written.
